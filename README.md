# BC Portfolio Starter

This repository should be forked and used for the Brand Creative Web exercise "Lets Make a Portfolio"

## How to use

1. Make sure you copy the contents of `.env.sample` to `.env.local` and ensure you have the correct API keys set from Contentful
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev` for a development build
4. Commit your code, and ideally once you have your Vercel account set up then builds will automatically happen

## Where to find things

`src/pages/index.js` is your homepage where you will edit, and `projects/[id].js` is where your individual "projects" will be edited.
